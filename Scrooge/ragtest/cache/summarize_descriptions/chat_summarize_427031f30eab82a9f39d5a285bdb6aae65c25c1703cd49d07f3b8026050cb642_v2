Despite his reluctance and general dislike for social gatherings, Scrooge's nephew consistently makes efforts to engage him in the Christmas spirit. Scrooge's nephew, who is a family member, feels sorry for Scrooge and extends invitations to him to join in Christmas celebrations. He visits Scrooge on Christmas Eve to wish him a merry Christmas, demonstrating his persistent goodwill and hope that Scrooge might embrace the joy of the season. Despite Scrooge's dismissive attitude and refusal to dine with his nephew, the nephew remains undeterred, continuing to invite Scrooge to partake in the festivities.
