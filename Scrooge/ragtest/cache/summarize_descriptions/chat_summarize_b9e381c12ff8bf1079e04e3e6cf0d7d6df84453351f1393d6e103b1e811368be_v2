Marley and Scrooge were once partners in a firm, which still bears the name \"Scrooge and Marley,\" indicating the lasting impact of their business relationship. Marley passed away seven years prior to the events described, yet his presence continues to influence Scrooge's life in profound ways.\n\nMarley's face mysteriously appears on the door knocker of Scrooge's residence, serving as a haunting reminder of their past association. This supernatural occurrence suggests that Marley is not merely a figure from Scrooge's past but also a spectral presence that haunts Scrooge's thoughts and experiences.
