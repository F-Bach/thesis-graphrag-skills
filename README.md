# Master's Thesis: Generative AI for Graph-Based Modeling and Interactive Querying of Organizational Expertise

This repository contains the code and data for a Master's Thesis focused on building and querying an employee skill knowledge graph using the GraphRAG framework.

## Repository Structure

This project is organized into several key directories:

*   **`Data processing`**: Contains scripts for processing the input JSON data. Please note that the original sensitive data is not included in this repository.
*   **`Docker`**: Includes the necessary Docker files for deploying the Streamlit front-end.
*   **`Graph Analysis`**: Provides the code of the graph analysis related to centrality metrics.
*   **`GraphRAG`**: Holds the core logic for executing the GraphRAG pipeline, which takes the processed data as input to build the knowledge graph.
*   **`GraphRAG API`**: An API that enables querying capabilities for the `graphrag-visualizer`. This service must be running to interact with the graph visualization tool.
*   **`Scrooge`**: A self-contained, dummy example that demonstrates a standard GraphRAG implementation on a sample dataset.

## GraphRAG Pipeline Steps

To generate the knowledge graph using GraphRAG, the following sequence of steps should be executed:

1.  **Environment Setup**: Create a Python virtual environment and install the `graphrag` library within it.
2.  **Project Initialization**: Create a dedicated folder for your project (the standard naming convention is `ragtest`) and navigate into this directory.
3.  **GraphRAG Initialization**: Execute the command `graphrag init` to set up the foundational project structure.
4.  **API Key Configuration**: Populate the `.env` file with the necessary API keys required for external service calls (e.g., Large Language Models).
5.  **Parameter Tuning**: Customize the `settings.yaml` file to align with the specific requirements and desired behaviors of your graph generation process.
6.  **Input Data Placement**: Copy your raw input data files into the designated `input/` folder within your project directory.
7.  **Graph Generation**: Execute the command `graphrag index` to initiate the graph generation process.

Upon successful execution, the `output/` folder will contain all the relevant data representing the constructed knowledge graph.



## Graph Visualization Steps

To visualize the generated knowledge graph, you will need to use the official `graphrag-visualizer` inside the `GraphRAG` folder. Follow these steps:

1.  Clone the `graphrag-visualizer` repository from its official source.
2.  Navigate into the cloned directory and install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.
3.  Copy the output files generated by the `GraphRAG` execution from this project into the `public/artifacts/` folder within the `graphrag-visualizer` directory.
4.  Ensure the `GraphRAG API` from this repository is active and running.
5.  Start the visualization tool by running `npm start` from the `graphrag-visualizer` directory.
