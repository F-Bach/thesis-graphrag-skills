# Master's Thesis: Generative AI for Graph-Based Modeling and Interactive Querying of Organizational Expertise

This repository contains the code and data for a Master's Thesis focused on building and querying an employee skill knowledge graph using the GraphRAG framework.

## Repository Structure

This project is organized into several key directories:

*   **`Data processing`**: Contains scripts for processing the input JSON data. Please note that the original sensitive data is not included in this repository.
*   **`Docker`**: Includes the necessary Docker files for deploying the Streamlit front-end.
*   **`Graph Analysis`**: Provides the code of the graph analysis related to centrality metrics.
*   **`GraphRAG`**: Holds the core logic for executing the GraphRAG pipeline, which takes the processed data as input to build the knowledge graph.
*   **`GraphRAG API`**: An API that enables querying capabilities for the `graphrag-visualizer`. This service must be running to interact with the graph visualization tool.
*   **`Scrooge`**: A self-contained, dummy example that demonstrates a standard GraphRAG implementation on a sample dataset.

## Graph Visualization Steps

To visualize the generated knowledge graph, you will need to use the official `graphrag-visualizer` inside the `GraphRAG` folder. Follow these steps:

1.  Clone the `graphrag-visualizer` repository from its official source.
2.  Navigate into the cloned directory and install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.
3.  Copy the output files generated by the `GraphRAG` execution from this project into the `public/artifacts/` folder within the `graphrag-visualizer` directory.
4.  Ensure the `GraphRAG API` from this repository is active and running.
5.  Start the visualization tool by running `npm start` from the `graphrag-visualizer` directory.
