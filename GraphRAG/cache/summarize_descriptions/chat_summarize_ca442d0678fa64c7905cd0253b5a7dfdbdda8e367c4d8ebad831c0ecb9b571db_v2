It is designed to facilitate the creation of web applications and APIs with Python, offering a modern and efficient framework for developers. FastAPI is known for its high performance, largely due to its asynchronous capabilities, which allow for handling multiple requests concurrently without blocking operations. This makes it particularly suitable for applications that require real-time data processing or high throughput.\n\nThe package is built on top of Starlette for the web parts and Pydantic for the data parts, ensuring both speed and reliability. FastAPI is celebrated for its ease of use, providing automatic generation of interactive API documentation with Swagger UI and ReDoc, which helps developers understand and test their APIs effortlessly. It also supports data validation and serialization, making it easier to manage data inputs and outputs.\n\nFastAPI's design emphasizes developer productivity and code maintainability, offering features like dependency injection, which simplifies the management of application components and promotes clean architecture. It also supports OAuth2 and other authentication mechanisms, making it a secure choice for building applications that require user authentication.\n\nThe package is compatible with Python 3.6 and above, leveraging Python's type hints to provide robust and automatic validation of request data. This feature not only enhances code readability but also reduces the likelihood of runtime errors, contributing to a smoother development experience.\n\nFastAPI is widely adopted in the industry due to its scalability and flexibility, allowing developers to build applications ranging from simple prototypes to complex systems. Its community is active and growing, providing a wealth of resources, tutorials, and plugins that extend its functionality.\n\nIn summary, FastAPI is a powerful and efficient Python package that is mentioned in the document and used by Gonzalo. It offers a comprehensive set of features for building modern web applications and APIs, emphasizing performance, security, and developer productivity.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1750153389, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 369, "prompt_tokens": 167, "total_tokens": 536, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
