It is a language that extends JavaScript by adding static type definitions, allowing developers to catch errors early in the development process and improve code quality. TypeScript is widely used in the software development industry for building large-scale applications due to its ability to provide better tooling and scalability compared to JavaScript alone. It is developed and maintained by Microsoft and has gained significant popularity among developers for its robust features and compatibility with existing JavaScript codebases. The language is designed to be a superset of JavaScript, meaning that any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code, making it easy for developers to transition from JavaScript to TypeScript. With its strong typing system, TypeScript helps developers write more predictable and maintainable code, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors. Additionally, TypeScript supports modern JavaScript features and can be transpiled to run on any environment that supports JavaScript, ensuring broad compatibility across different platforms and devices. As a result, TypeScript has become a preferred choice for many developers, including Daniel, Guillermo, and Jose, who appreciate its ability to enhance productivity and streamline the development process.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1750243084, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 238, "prompt_tokens": 181, "total_tokens": 419, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
