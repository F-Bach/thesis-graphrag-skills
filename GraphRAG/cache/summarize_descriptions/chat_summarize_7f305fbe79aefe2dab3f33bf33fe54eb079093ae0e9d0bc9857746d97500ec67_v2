This skill involves the distribution of incoming application or network traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, in one or more Availability Zones. Elastic Load Balancing helps ensure that no single target is overwhelmed with too much traffic, thereby improving the availability and reliability of applications. It automatically scales its capacity to meet the demands of incoming traffic, providing a seamless user experience even during high traffic periods. By possessing this skill, Noelia and Pablo are equipped to manage and optimize the performance of applications, ensuring efficient load distribution and minimizing the risk of downtime. Their expertise in Elastic Load Balancing enables them to implement strategies that enhance the scalability and fault tolerance of systems, making them valuable assets in environments that require robust and resilient infrastructure solutions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1750149948, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 169, "prompt_tokens": 173, "total_tokens": 342, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
