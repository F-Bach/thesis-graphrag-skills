It is widely recognized for its versatility and ease of use in web development. PHP, which stands for Hypertext Preprocessor, is a server-side scripting language designed primarily for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language. It is embedded within HTML, making it a popular choice for creating dynamic and interactive websites.\n\nPHP is open-source, meaning it is freely available for anyone to use and modify, which has contributed to its widespread adoption and a large community of developers who contribute to its ongoing development and improvement. The language is known for its simplicity and speed, allowing developers to quickly build and deploy web applications.\n\nOne of PHP's key features is its ability to connect to various database systems, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle, making it a powerful tool for creating data-driven websites. It also supports a wide range of protocols, including HTTP, FTP, and LDAP, and can be used to create applications that run on different platforms, such as Windows, Linux, and macOS.\n\nPHP has evolved significantly since its creation in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf. It has undergone numerous updates and improvements, with the latest versions offering enhanced performance, security, and functionality. PHP 8, the most recent major release, introduced features such as JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation, which improves execution speed, and new syntax enhancements that make coding more efficient and readable.\n\nThe language is supported by a vast ecosystem of frameworks and libraries, such as Laravel, Symfony, and CodeIgniter, which provide developers with tools to streamline the development process and implement best practices. These frameworks offer pre-built modules and components that simplify common tasks, such as authentication, routing, and database management.\n\nPHP is also known for its strong community support, with numerous forums, tutorials, and documentation available online to assist developers of all skill levels. This community-driven approach ensures that PHP remains up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in web development.\n\nIn summary, PHP is a robust and flexible programming language known by ELISA and JAIME, among many others, for its ability to create dynamic and interactive web applications. Its open-source nature, extensive database connectivity, and support for various protocols make it a popular choice for developers worldwide. With continuous updates and a strong community backing, PHP remains a vital tool in the web development landscape.\",2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n328,RAMON,GRADLE,RAMON conoce el paquete de programación Gradle en Groovy,78\r\n1737,JAIME,WEB DEVELOPER,JAIME tiene experiencia laboral como Web Developer durante 1 año,52\r\n1745,JAIME,MICROSOFT POWER BI,JAIME posee la habilidad técnica de Microsoft Power Bi,50\r\n1747,JAIME,SAFE 5,JAIME posee la habilidad técnica de SAFE 5,50\r\n1748,JAIME,GITHUB,JAIME posee la habilidad técnica de GitHub,50\r\n1750,JAIME,PHOTOSHOP,JAIME posee la habilidad técnica de PhotoShop,50\r\n1756,JAIME,UNITY,\"JAIME conoce el paquete de lenguaje de programación Unity\nJAIME conoce el lenguaje de programación Unity\",50\r\n1757,JAIME,VUEJS,JAIME conoce el lenguaje de programación VueJs,50\r\n1759,JAIME,XML,JAIME conoce el lenguaje de programación XML,50\r\n1760,JAIME,MICROSOFT SQL,JAIME conoce el lenguaje de programación Microsoft SQL,50\r\n1761,JAIME,ORACLE SQL,JAIME conoce el lenguaje de programación Oracle SQL,50\r\n1765,JAIME,MEDIATR,JAIME conoce el paquete de lenguaje de programación MediatR,50\r\n1785,JAIME,CYPRESS,JAIME conoce el paquete de lenguaje de programación Cypress,50\r\n145,BLANCA,VISUAL BASIC,BLANCA conoce el lenguaje de programación Visual Basic,33\r\n634,ELISA,PHP,ELISA conoce el lenguaje de programación PHP,32\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
